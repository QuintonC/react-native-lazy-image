# React Native Lazy Image Example

While building an application at work I created a component that I found useful. I thought it might be helpful to provide an example of that component here on Github, so I created a small react-native started project with the component in it.

## Example

## Installation

Clone the project

Navigate to the directory

Run `yarn install`


Run the following:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && react-native run-ios
```

## Questions?
Feel free to ask questions or create a  PR with any updates that you think might help make this component better.

## Notes
This could be done simpler with the native Animated API, however I was already using react-native-animatable in my project, so it was simple to just pull that into the component for my purposes.
